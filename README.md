# CFD_2D_Laplace_Transform
Imperial College London-CFD

The MATLAB programming training of 2D Laplace Transform Equation to simulate 2D temperature delivering through a space;

The concentrated function is:
                                (del)^2T = 0;
The questions are listing below:

*Use TWO numerical schemes to discretize your equation and solve
the PDE assuming the following boundary conditions T = 1@x = 0,
T = cos(6 ∗3/2πy) + 1@x = 1, T = 1@y = 1. T = (1 + x)@y = 0. In
the domain there is a point at T = 1.5 located at x = 0.5, y = 0.5
and one T = 0.5 located at x = 0.2, y = 0.2. Discuss the advantage
of one scheme against the other and plot the iso-contours of the two
dimensional thermal field in both cases.

*Using the same boundary conditions of question c, plot e_max versus
∆x on a set of log-log axes and comment on the form of the plot.
Mesh with ∆x=∆y, at least 3 different mesh sizes. Explain how you
have decided the minimum ∆x=∆y of your computational domain
